ssPopModel
==========

ssPopModel is a R package that uses size-structured matrix population model to estimate hourly division rates of microbial populations from SeaFlow data. These estimates are independent of variations in cell abundance and can be used to study physiologically-driven changes in population dynamics. The model is described in:
